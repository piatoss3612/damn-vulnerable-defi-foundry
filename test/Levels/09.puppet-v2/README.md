# Challenge #9 - Puppet V2

The developers of the [previous pool](https://github.com/piatoss3612/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry/tree/v3/src/Contracts/08.puppet) seem to have learned the lesson. And released a new version!

Now theyâ€™re using a [Uniswap v2 exchange](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/introduction) as a price oracle, along with the recommended utility libraries. That should be enough.

You start with 20 ETH and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The pool has a million DVT tokens in balance. You know what to do.
